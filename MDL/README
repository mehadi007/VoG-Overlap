MDL_faster_Step_noClaim
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  The step algorithm in the under-preparation paper. At every iteration
  we pick the ''best'' structure, that is the structure that minimizes 
  the total encoding cost.

MDL_faster		
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  The greedy heuristic of the original VoG paper made EVEN
  faster by keeping only the diff of the error structures
  and using them to revert to a previous state if a newly 
  added structure is removed from the summary (for not further
  decreasing the encoding cost)

  SPEEDUP: For epinions, from >30h, the runtime is down to 24 seconds!

           For enron: 9 seconds!

MDL_optGreedy_faster
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  The step heuristic of the new work made faster thanks to the
  diff trick for the error structures.

  SPEEDUP: For epinions, the runtime is

MDL_fixed_negative:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  The greedy heuristic of the original VoG paper made faster 
  by avoiding to recompute the encoding cost from scratch at
  each structure addition. It is slow, because it copies the 
  old error structures every time a new structure is temporarily
  added to the model.

  For enron: 1766 seconds = 29.4 mins

MDL_optGreedy
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  The step heuristic of the new work, which adds to the model
  the "best" structure greedily. That is, it does not consider
  the structures in order of decreasing encoding cost as suggested
  in our initial VoG paper. Since that is quadratic to the number
  of structures, we use a claim based on which if a structure does
  not help decrease the encoding cost at some point, it will never 
  do, and thus it's not worth considering it.
